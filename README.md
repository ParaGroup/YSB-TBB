# YSB-TBB
This repository provides a simplified implementation of the Yahoo! Streaming Benchmark in Intel TBB (FlowGraph). The version of the YSB is the one mentioned in:

https://databricks.com/blog/2017/10/11/benchmarking-structured-streaming-on-databricks-runtime-against-state-of-the-art-streaming-systems.html

where the interaction with external services has been removed to test the peak performance of different Stream Processing Systems.
